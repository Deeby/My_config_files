ABOUT:

The nouveKDEGray icon set is made by Pedram Pourang (aka Tsu Jan), to be used only with dark KDE/Qt themes -- i.e. against sufficiently dark backgrounds -- under KDE or LXQT. Its first version was released in March 2013.

nouveKDEGray is partly based on nouveGnomeGray, another icon set created by the same author when he used Gnome. Some of its icons are made by starting from the KDE and GNOME default icon sets, which can be found in the repositories of Debian and other Linux distros.
