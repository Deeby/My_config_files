If you update the set, don't forget to recreate the icon cache by choosing another icon set in System Settings > Icons > Icons > Theme, selecting nouveKDEGray again and clicking Apply.

Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' (or '~/.icons/') and select it from Configuration Center > Appearance > Icon theme.

In KDE4, the icon installation directory was '~/.kde/share/icons/'. In some distros, the KDE settings directory was '~/.kde4/' instead of '~/.kde/'. Select nouveKDEGray in System Settings > Application Appearance > Icons and click Apply.
